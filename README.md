         The program defines a Book class to model books, encapsulating essential attributes such as title, author, and publication year. This class provides an organized structure for handling book-related data and can easily be modified or expanded in the future. The class includes a description() method that formats the book’s information into a readable string, which is useful for displaying book details. The program creates instances of the Book class for two books (book1 and book2) and stores these objects in a list (books), showcasing how the class can represent and manipulate collections of books. Several functions, such as sort_books_by_year(books) and find_book(book_name, books), are also defined to enhance the program's functionality. The sort_books_by_year() function sorts a list of Book objects by their publication year, using Python’s sorted() function with a lambda expression. If the list is empty, it raises a ValueError, which is handled in the function. The find_book() function searches for a book by its title in a case-insensitive manner and returns the corresponding Book object if found, or None if not. These functions help modularize the code, making it easier to maintain and extend. The program also employs both for and while loops to handle repeated tasks. The for loop iterates through a sorted list of books to display each book's description, while the while loop is used to repeatedly ask for user input until valid data is provided, such as when asking for the user's age or number input. Another while loop is used to enable an interactive book search, where the loop continues prompting the user for book titles until they type 'exit'. This design improves the program's clarity and maintainability, providing a solid foundation for further enhancements
